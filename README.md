# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview 

The purpose of this analaysis is to assess data about the fares for each city type: urban, suburban and rural. With this type of data analysis it is easier for Pyber to assess the total and average rides and fares in the period of time (january - april 2019). Finally the information is presented in a table. This representation of the data is useful to Pyber to make decisions regarding the most rides and fares by city type, the average fare by city type, etc... so they can decide if they could focus their attention to one type of city over the others, or if it is worthy to kee operations in the three type of cities.

# Results 

To begin wit hte analysis, the table below shows the summary of the total and average rides and fares by type of city. Also, as we see the total number of drivers per type of city. In this case, the city with the most drivers, the most amount of rides and the highest fares is the urban type of city. Next, we find the suburban and finally the rural city type is has the fewest total rides, less drivers and smallest total fares. However, on the average fare per ride the rural city is higher, which is translated into more money spent per ride. It would be interesting to see why is the reason for this (longer distances, higher prices, more time spent per ride?), or if it is only because of the lower amount of total drivers.

On reverse order to the total rides, drivers and fares, the rural and then the suburban city have better ratios on the average fare per ride and per driver, and the lowest average is in the urban city. Firsthand, even if the total fare is higher, there are more drivers and rides. However, further analysis should be made to understand each city's characteristics and riders behavior (distances traveled, time spent per ride, prices of each ride...). 

However, at the end od the day revenue is one of the important indicators to the companies, including Pyber. For them, this is mainly driven by the total amount of fares. In the next chart we can appreciate the be visual representation of the total fares by city type. This leads us to another analysis.

The table below shows the fares by city type from january to april 2019. Consistent with the previous chart, the type of city with the highest amount per fare is the urban, flowwed by the subirban and finally the rural type. There are many facts to see from this chart:
  
  1. The behavior of the three lines, in general, is similar. For the analyzed period, all start and end at a similar fare rateThe three types of cities have an increase of fares in the second part of february
